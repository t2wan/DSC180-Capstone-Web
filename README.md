# DSC180-Capstone-Web

In the front-end web development, we built the front webs. We utilize hyper text markup language(HTML) to structure and design in a web browser with the assistance of Cascading style sheeting(CSS) - style presentation and JavaScript(JS) enabled to interactive web pages. Furthermore, we utilized LayUI as a front-end UI framework to make it more organized. It is usable for users to upload their own files, the knowledge base, showing the processing steps from autophrase and some text and word cloud visualization at the end.

In the back-end web development, we use Spring MVC and Spring as the application framework to control the back-end of the web with JDK and Tomcat required implementation and configuration. It will read the input file and stored into the web folder; call the run.py file to start the AutoPhrase processing; read the text's result; read and store the images; and produce the top 20 valuable phrases with corresponding size in the word cloud.
